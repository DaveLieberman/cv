  <h2>Resolution enhancement, 4X as many DICOM slices</h2>
  <dl>
    <p>
      <em><h4><dt>The image deck on the left is the original sqquence of dicom
       images, and the enhanced spatial resolution version on the right,
      <dt>has 4 times as many slices, reducing slice thickness from 2mm to
      0.5mm. A compelling characteristic of this algorithm, is that if
      <dt>4 consencutive slices are averaged, then the enhanced version precisly
      reproduces the low resolution original. Therefore, the high
      <dt>resolution version is an actual feasible solution.</h4></em>
